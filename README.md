# Hotel Website

This is a simple hotel website project that I created to practice **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and basic **JavaScript** concepts.  
The website presents a modern and responsive design, structured with semantic HTML tags and styled with custom CSS.  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of front-end web development and serves as a learning project.

## Features
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Navigation bar with smooth scrolling
- Room showcase with text and image alignment
- Contact and reservation form
- Clean and minimal UI design

## Purpose of the Project
The main goal of this project is to improve my **front-end development skills** by practicing:
- How to build semantic and accessible HTML pages
- How to design layouts using CSS
- Creating detailed page layouts with Flexbox
- How to structure a small real-world website
